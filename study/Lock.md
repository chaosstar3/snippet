-   semaphore
    -   Pros: pass control to other thread
    -   Cons: sleep required
-   spinlock
    -   Pros: small lock overhead
    -   Cons: spin overhead
-   rwlock
    -   multiple read lock allowed
    -   Cons: write starvation
-   seqlock
    -   read seq, read data, check seq, if updated retry
    -   write seq and update
    -   Pros: prevent write starvation

-   RCU (Read-Copy-Update)
    -   pointer referenced data structure
    -   Read: just read
    -   Write: copy to new mem, change pointer(atomic)
